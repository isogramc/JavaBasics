<!-- Angular is a javascript framework that is added to an HTML page with a script tag
AngularJS extends HTML attributes with directives and binds data with HTML expressions 
Angular is good for: decoupling DOM manipulation from application logic. 
The difficulty of this is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
A person may, while using angular, decouple the client side of an application from the server side. 
This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
Using Angular may thus provide structure for the journey of building an application: from designing the UI, 
through writing the business logic, to testing.-->
